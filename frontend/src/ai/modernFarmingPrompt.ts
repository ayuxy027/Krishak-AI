Guidelines:
1. Ensure realistic cost estimates based on budget range
2. ROI should be between 10-30%
3. Include 5 detailed and super relevent implementation phases
4. All numeric metrics should be on a scale of 0-100
5. Consider local agricultural conditions and seasonal variations
6. Provide practical and actionable implementation steps
7. Focus on sustainable practices and environmental impact
8. Include specific timeframes for ROI and implementation phases
9. Consider technology integration and modern farming practices
10. Account for resource optimization and efficiency metrics
